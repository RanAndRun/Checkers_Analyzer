This is my computer science final project at school. this project contains a checkers game with GUI - made with pygame, 
an analysis function that can help users to get better and learn from their mistakes,
an online option for playing with a friend- made with sockets, a database that contains number of win and losses and displays a graph of win-rate over time.

Ran.
